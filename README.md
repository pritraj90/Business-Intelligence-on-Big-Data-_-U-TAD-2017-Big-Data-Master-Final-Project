Business Intelligence on Big Data _ U-TAD 2017 Big Data Expert Program Final Project

This is the final project I had to do obtain my diploma in my Big Data Expert Program in U-TAD that I finished in September 2017. 
It uses the following technologies: Apache Spark v2.2.0; Python v2.7.3; Jupyter Notebook (PySpark); HDFS; Hive; Cloudera Impala; 
Cloudera HUE and Tableau.

Big Data Projects can be classified into two main groups: operative and research projects. Operative projects are the ones currently 
being done using the traditional tools but using Big Data technologies to carry them out on more data, faster, and spending less money. 
These are the projects carried out by companies that are entering the Big Data world. Business Intelligence, the capability to turn data 
into information, and information into knowledge, so that the decision-making process in businesses can be optimized, may be one example 
of these operations improvement projects. In this project we use meteorological data to turn them into knowledge and be able to exploit 
them visually.
